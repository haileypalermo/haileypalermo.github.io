            There are six players on each time. The team that wins the pregame coin toss gets the opportunity to serve the ball first. 
            The aim of the server is to hit the ball over the net from behind the baseline over to the opposition's team half to start 
            a rally. More specifically, the maximum of three consecutive touches after which they have to send the ball into the 
            opposition's half. There are four main movements in volleyball; serving, passing, bumping, and hitting (otherwise known as spiking).
            The player that gets the second touch is usually the setter, who sends the ball up to the edge of the net as close as possible setting 
            up the spike. To counterattack, the opposing team attempts to block the ball by usually positioning their tallest and most athletic 
            players close to the net.

            The volleyball court is 18m (59ft) long and 9m (29.5 ft) wide. The volleyball net is 2.43 (7.97 ft) tall net for men's and 2.24 m 
            (7.35 ft) tall for women's competition. Volleyball matches are best of five set contests. The first four sets are played until one 
            team scores 25 points. However, if the two teams are tied, both winning two sets each after four total sets, then a fifth set is 
            played to 15 points. Additionally, if the game is tied in the fifth set, the set continues until one of the teams builds a two point 
            lead over the other.

           There are various ways teams can lose a point other than letting the ball drop. For example, if the player that is serving steps over
           the back line, they lose the point and the other team serves. Also, if any body part of a player touches the net, especially the outside
           and right side hitters, then they automatically lose the point. Teams may also lose points for a double hit, taking more than three touches
           before hitting the ball over the net, and if they hit the ball beyond the boundary line.
