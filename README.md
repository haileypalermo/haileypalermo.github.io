  <h1>The Sport of Volleyball</h1>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Originally known as mintonette, volleyball is a sport that was created in 1895 by William G Morgan in the state of Massachusetts. Morgan, the physical director of Young Men's Christian Association in Holyoke Massachusetts, came up with the idea so that people who found basketball too difficult could participate in an alternative activity. Since a basketball was too heavy to use, a specific ball was created in 1900 that was more light weight. Volleyball is very popular and well known as it is played by 800 million people worldwide. More specifically, it is most played in Asia. </p>
  <p>In April of 1947, the Federation Internationale de Volleyball was created. Representatives from 14 nations - Belgium, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Uruguay, the USA and Yugoslavia - met in Paris under the leadership of France’s Paul Libaud to set up the association that would govern volleyball at the international level. The first volleyball World Championships for men was held in 1949 in Prague as well as the World Championships for women a few years later in 1952. Howeverm at this time, volleyball was not welcomed into the Olympics.<p>
  <p>Finally, in 1957, indoor volleyball was initiated into the Olympics by the International Olympic Committee. Volleyball was debuted into the Olympics at the 1964 Games that took place in Tokyo, Japan. Only six teams played in the women’s category in the 1964 edition of the Games, that number doubled by 1988 and has remained so ever since. Another type of volleyball known as beach volleyball was included in the Olympic programme for the Atlanta Games in 1996. There are many differences between indoor volleyball and beach volleyball. For example, in beach volleyball there are only two players allowed on the court. As a result, the court is 3 feet shorter at each end due to the lack of players. Also, indoor volleyball is played until one team reaches 25 points, unlike beach volleyball which is 21 points. Finally, the ball is lighter in beach volleyball in order for it to float longer to give players more time to get under it since there are only two on the court.<p>
